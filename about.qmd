I'm Felix, a final-year Ph.D. student in Sociology at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, currently living in Boston with my partner and two cats. I'm a German citizen with a valid U.S. work permit.

I hold a Bachelor's of Arts degree in Political Science (University of Regensburg), a Master's of Science from Linköping University, and will defend my Ph.D. in Sociology at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris in early 2026. During my Ph.D., I also spent a year as a visiting researcher at Duke University.
