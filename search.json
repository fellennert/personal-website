    "text": "What I like about the social sciences is that instead of just building models to predict outcomes, we get to dig into the why behind human behavior. Given that we all witness human behavior all the time, everyone has their own little theories of why people do what they do. The challenge of social science research is to move beyond this anecdotal evidence and figure out what actually drives behavior on a larger scale. The crux is then to communicate these insights in a way that is understandable and useful to others. On this page, I share some of the academic research projects that I conducted during my Ph.D.\n\nMediated Cues. How Elite Polarization is Transported Through the Media\nwith Väinö Yrjänäinen and Måns Magnusson\nDo people become more polarized because politicians say polarizing things in the news, or do politicians say polarizing things because people are already polarized? We studied 25 years of French newspaper coverage and public opinion surveys to find out. The answer: both happen, but it depends on the issue. For some topics, media coverage of elite politicians clearly drives public opinion. For others, politicians seem to follow where public opinion is already going. This means there’s no one-size-fits-all explanation for how political polarization spreads.\n\n\nHow Elite Negativity Shapes Voter Affect: Evidence from the 2021 German Federal Election\nsolo-authored; currently under review at German Politics\nWhen a political party attacks its opponents on Twitter, does it make voters dislike those opponents more? Using transformer models and OLS regression, I analyzed tweets from candidates in Germany’s 2021 election alongside biweekly voter survey data to find out. The answer is yes: when Party A criticizes Party B on social media, Party A’s supporters report disliking Party B more. The effect is strongest among people who already identify strongly with their party, and it holds up regardless of whether the parties might form a coalition together or how ideologically similar they are. Also, the opposite is not true: a party don’t criticize other parties more if they know that their supporters don’t like these parties.\n\n\nDo Liberals Drive Volvos Everywhere? Assessing Cultural Bundles in Sweden\nwith Anastasia Menshikova, Elida Izani Binti Ibrahim, and Miriam Hurtado Bodell; currently under review at Social Media+Society\nIn the U.S., we know that political views often cluster with lifestyle choices – like the stereotype that liberals drive Priuses. But does this happen in countries with more than two major parties? We analyzed what 12,000 politically active Swedish Twitter users follow using mixed membership clustering to see if political affiliation predicts their cultural tastes. It does. Swedish voters’ media consumption, cultural interests, religious views, and even sense of humor align with their partisan identity. Political polarization isn’t just about policy disagreements – it’s seeping into everyday lifestyle choices, even in a multi-party democracy like Sweden.\n\n\nMedia Slant as Political Refraction. Measuring Political Media Slant and Polarization in the French Media Landscape\nwith Rubing Shen, Arnault Chatelain, and Etienne Ollion\nHow can we measure whether a newspaper leans left or right without relying on subjective judgments? We developed a new method that analyzes how journalists talk about political issues differently than politicians do. By looking at subtle differences in word choice and framing, we can detect political bias at a very fine level, down to individual paragraphs. We tested this on major French newspapers from 2000-2010 and found that mainstream media became increasingly polarized during this period. This gives researchers and the public a tool to track media bias objectively over time.\n\n\nPerceptions of Intergenerational Mobility in Germany, Sweden, and the UK: Insights from Machine-Learning Text Analysis\nwith Alexi Gugushvili and Patrick Präg; preprint; currently under review at European Journal of Sociology\nWhen people compare their lives to their parents’, what are they actually comparing? We used LLMs and clustering-algorithms to analyze thousands of open-ended survey responses from Germany, Sweden, and the UK. While traditional research focuses on income, education, and job status, we found that people think about much more: home ownership, family life, freedom, lifestyle choices, and opportunities. What matters also varies dramatically by country: Swedes emphasize education, Brits focus on housing, Germans talk about freedom and lifestyle. Gender matters too: women are more likely to mention education and family, while men focus on income and career. Understanding what people actually care about when they think about social mobility gives us a richer picture than traditional metrics alone."

    "text": "Portrait of Felix\n\n\nHi! My name is Felix and this is my personal website. I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Sociology at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. I live in Boston with my partner (who is doing her Ph.D. in Sociology, too) and two gorgeous cats. I am a German citizen and have a valid work permit for the US.\nI spent years doing research in the field of cultural and political sociology, asking big questions about human behavior and waiting even longer for answers. This career gave me great opportunities: I lived in Germany, Sweden, France, and the U.S., I met great and interesting people, and learned a lot. However, between endless research timelines, publishing and revision cycles, and the slow churn of academic life, I also realized that I was craving something different: the chance to see my work make an impact more immediately and directly. Who cares about a ten-page journal article that gets 1,000 downloads and maybe influences a few other researchers if it doesn’t change anything in the real world?\nThe closest you can get to experiencing impact in academia is through teaching and conference visits. I have been teaching younger folks how to go after social science questions in R and Python throughout my entire academic career (starting right after graduating from my Bachelor’s program) and also attended and presented at more than 10 academic conferences. These occasions showed me what I love most about this work: solving questions and telling stories with data. There is nothing I enjoy more than the moment when a visualization clicks, when a pattern emerges from messy data, when numbers suddenly tell a story that changes how someone sees a problem. I want to do that outside the university, with data that’s as exciting and dynamic as the questions it can answer.\nThat desire for real-world impact led me to work as a consulting analyst for Statistical Horizons, where I got my first taste of what data work looks like outside academia. I crunched performance data for reports and dashboards, prepared marketing campaigns using customer data that I collected online, and created reports that made an immediate and measurable impact. It confirmed what I suspected: I want to do this full-time.\nSo I am looking for data analyst and data science roles where I can combine rigorous methodology with practical problem-solving. Where I can dive into rich datasets, uncover insights that actually shift decisions, and communicate findings in ways that resonate with and help the people who need them.\nThis portfolio is a glimpse of how I work – curious, methodical, sometimes a bit outside the box, but always driven by a desire to understand and explain. If you like what you see here, please reach out. I would love to connect and explore how I can bring this approach to your team."
