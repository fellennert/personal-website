    "text": "This section is where theory meets practice. Each project here represents a different slice of what I bring to data work: collecting messy data from the web, building and comparing machine learning models, applying cutting-edge NLP techniques, creating interactive tools to make my partner happy, and making complex methods accessible to others.\nSome of these grew out of pure curiosity (what patterns emerge in song lyrics? Can we detect “eras”?), others from practical needs (how do I make my teaching materials easily searchable for my students?), and a few from different research challenges (what is the best classifier for a job? how good are LLMs actually? is political polarization really so hot?). Together, they show how I approach problems: I start with a question, pick the right tools and data for the job, and don’t stop until I’ve found an answer worth sharing.\nYou’ll see a mix of techniques here: classic machine learning, modern transformer models, web scraping, interactive dashboards, and RAG applications. But the thread that runs through all of them is the same: how can I turn raw data into understandable insights, into something people can actually understand and use.\n\nPolarization terms\nThis emerged as part of writing the introductory chapter for my dissertation on political polarization. Political polarization has been coined “Word of the Year 2024” by Merriam Webster, reflecting the search traffic on their page. I was wondering whether there would be different ways to document such a surge in attention. Therefore, I moved to Google Trends (“are people interested in political polarization?”), Google Scholar (“are researchers interested in political polarization?”), and the New York Times API (“are journalists interested in political polarization?”). Turns out, yes, there’s been an overall increase in attention. This summary can serve as an example of how to scrape valuable data sources and navigate obstacles such as CAPTCHAs. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nTraining and comparing ML classifiers\nOne topic of a graduate class I taught on Computational Social Science was supervised classification of text. I showed the students different approaches for doing this (simple, dictionary-based; more advanced, using bag-of-words-based models; and advanced, using BERT). To show the students how capable these different models are, I decided to train and compare several machine learning classifiers. Due to time constraints, I resorted to a pre-labeled data set that was available on Kaggle, containing IMDb reviews of movies. Here’s a little report on my results, with an emphasis on the impact of preprocessing and the number of training examples. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nBERTopic on survey responses\nFor a research paper, I needed to analyze open-ended survey responses. They came with particular challenges: (a) they were very short, rendering “classic” mixed membership models useless; (b) they came in three different languages (English, German, Swedish). To classify the responses into different “topics”, I decided to use BERTopic, a modern topic modeling approach based on transformer embeddings. This approach also allowed me to pre-specify topics based on prior research, making it particularly useful for theory-guided research where you already have an idea of what’s in the text. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nShiny advent calendar\nPh.D. students do not have tremendous purchasing power and my partner and I had to live in different places for a year. However, I knew that I would come back to Durham, NC (where she lived at the time) and we would spend spring and summer together. To make the distance and wait more bearable, I created a Shiny app that served as an advent calendar for us. Each day, a new suggestion for a shared “date activity” would pop up, like a boat rental or a nice restaurant. It was a fun way to combine my coding skills with a personal touch, and it made the holiday season special despite the distance. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nTaylor Swift lyrics\nI can’t say that I have been a Taylor Swift fan since her early days. However, I will readily admit that her songwriting does a tremendous job at capturing the lived experience of a Millenial and as she aged her songs also matured (and there are all these fun Shakespeare references). I was curious whether I could find patterns in her lyrics that correspond to different “eras” of her music career. The data were readily available, neatly wrapped in an R package, so I processed the text, and went to town with various NLP techniques to see if distinct themes or styles emerged over time. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nRAG of teaching materials\nTo help my students prepare for their final papers and making a “more targeted” GPT for them, I wanted to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that could answer their questions based on the materials I provided throughout the semester. This involved collecting lecture notes, slides, and reading materials, casting them into a machine-readable format, and then setting up a RAG pipeline that could retrieve relevant information, coupled with a local LLM to generate coherent answers. The goal was to make studying more interactive and efficient for my students. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nTranscription tutorial\nSocial scientists use plenty of text data for their research due to the fact that its readily available and easily analyzable. However, an in my experience often overlooked source of text data are audio or video recordings. Interviews, focus groups, speeches, and even podcasts can be treasure troves of data. To help fellow researchers get started with transcribing audio data into text, I created a tutorial that walks through the process using popular tools and services. The tutorial covers everything from speaker diarization with pyannote (for instance, if you have interview or focus group recordings) to using a large model in the background (OpenAI Whisper) to ensure high accuracy in your transcriptions. Unlike tools, such as Zoom’s transcription software, my approach is fully free and the data will not be used for training the providers’ models – making it well-suited for sensitive data. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nUsing LLMs for coding qualitative data\nQualitative data analysis often involves coding text data into different categories or themes. This can be a time-consuming and subjective process. To explore how large language models (LLMs) can assist in this task, I set up an experiment where I used an LLM to code a set of qualitative data and compared its performance to a human coder (me). The goal was to assess the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of using LLMs for qualitative coding, and to identify potential benefits and limitations of this approach. The approach I suggest works across languages (depending on LLM choice), is fairly quick and robust. Also, it runs locally (at least on my 2022 MacBook Pro M1 Pro), thus the data will never be shared with other companies (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). READ MORE HERE."

These are important, but my co-authors and I kept wondering: is that what people actually think about when they compare themselves to their parents?\nTraditional mobility research imposes our categories on people. Qualitative research lets people speak for themselves but involves small samples that can’t be compared across countries. Hence, in this project, my collaborators and I asked: what if we could combine both approaches; the scale of survey research with the openness of qualitative inquiry?"

    "section": "What We Did",
    "text": "What We Did\nWe surveyed nearly 5,000 people across Germany, Sweden, and the UK with one simple open-ended question: “When you compare how well you have done in life with your parents, what is the most important thing that you compare?”\nRespondents could write as much or as little as they wanted. We got back responses in three languages (German, English, and Swedish) with a median length of 4 words and a mean of 7.3 words. Short texts. Multiple languages. Nearly 5,000 responses.\nThis presented exactly the kind of challenge that traditional topic modeling approaches struggle with. Bayesian mixed-membership models like Structural Topic Models work by treating documents as “bags of words” and identifying topics as words that frequently co-occur within documents. But when your documents are only 4-7 words long, you don’t get much co-occurrence. And when you’re working across three languages, simple word-matching approaches fail to recognize that “income,” “Einkommen,” and “inkomst” refer to the same concept.This created a methodological challenge for me – as I was in charge of the analysis: how do you systematically analyze thousands of brief, multilingual text responses?\nI opted to use BERTopic, a machine learning approach that understands semantic meaning across languages. Unlike traditional topic modeling (which counts word co-occurrence), BERTopic uses contextual embeddings to recognize that “income,” “Einkommen,” and “inkomst” refer to the same concept even when they don’t appear in the same documents.\nThe pipeline is as follows: SBERT embedded responses in 512-dimensional semantic space \\(\\rightarrow\\) UMAP reduced dimensionality \\(\\rightarrow\\) HDBSCAN identified clusters \\(\\rightarrow\\) c-TF-IDF generated interpretable topic labels.\nWe started with fully inductive exploration (79 topics), then used theory-informed seed phrases for semi-supervised classification into 12 final categories."

    "text": "What We Found\nConventional measures matter, but they’re only half the story. Yes, income, education, and occupation appeared prominently. But combined, they accounted for less than half of what people mentioned.\nHousing dominates UK responses. Home ownership concerns were 3x more prevalent in the UK than Germany or Sweden – a methodological validation that our approach captures real contextual differences.\nThe categories vary systematically. Swedes emphasized education comparisons; Germans focused on freedom and lifestyle; women highlighted education and family while men emphasized income; upwardly mobile people mentioned education and opportunities while downwardly mobile people focused on housing and economic instability.\nEmerging dimensions matter. Family life, economic security, lifestyle/freedom, well-being, climate concerns, and social relationships all appeared as distinct categories. A person might have more education and income than their parents but still feel downwardly mobile due to housing insecurity or precarity—and our method captures that."

    "text": "Takeaways\nMy biggest takeaway isn’t a finding but a conviction about methods: we don’t have to choose between qualitative richness and quantitative rigor. Computational text analysis, done thoughtfully, bridges these traditions.\nThe iterative approach mattered tremendously in bridging this gap: inductive exploration revealed what people actually talked about, then theory-informed refinement made it analytically useful. Neither pure induction nor pure deduction would have worked as well.\nNot all technical approaches work for all data. We needed BERTopic specifically because:\n\nour responses were short (and traditional topic models need longer texts)\nthey were multilingual (requiring semantic embeddings, not word matching)\nwe wanted both exploration and validation (benefiting from the semi-supervised workflow).\n\nFor broader research applications: when you want to know what people think without constraining their responses, open-ended questions + computational text analysis + representative sampling gives you something neither purely qualitative nor purely quantitative methods can provide alone. The barrier between these traditions keeps getting lower—we should take advantage of that.\nReality is almost always more complex than our theories predict. Sometimes our measurement can reflect that complexity."

Thus, I started this project wondering: what data could we use to get both people’s lifestyle interests (e.g., the music they like, the blogs they enjoy reading) but also what’s their political leaning. I turned to Twitter, since users, on the one hand, are interested to follow their favorite politicians (which I can use to infer their political leaning) but also the stuff they’re interested in in their day-to-day life.\nI collected data on 11,000 politically engaged Swedish Twitter users and analyzed their following patterns using mixed membership clustering – a technique that allows people to belong to multiple communities simultaneously, capturing the messy reality of how we actually engage with content online.\nTo have my models cut through the noise, I used a clustering approach where I could pre-specify particular clusters (such as political parties). The lifestyle interest cluster was pre-specified with interests I found by applying an inductive model. This yielded clusters such as “Soccer”, “Women & LGBTQ rights”, “Entertainers”, or “Museums” which I then formalized in the constrained, pre-specified model.\nI fitted politics and lifestyle models separately. Thus, I got one distribution of “membership” of a user with a certain party (roughly, the share of politicians they follow from a given party), which we interpreted as their political leaning, and a distribution of how much interest they take in certain lifestyles.\nFinally, I could go to work and correlate these two scores in various ways and also look at which interests co-occur together using Hierarchical clustering. I further used expert-survey data to incorporate left-right position of the parties and inferred the users’ gender by looking at their profile and performing fuzzy-matching using existing dictionaries of gendered Swedish first names."

This is also hardly affected by gender.\n\n\n\nCorrelations of lifestyle interests with political position of users. The x-axis can be interpreted as left-right leaning with more negative scores indicating a stronger left-leaning.\n\n\nThe most surprising finding? Even with eight parties to choose from, Swedish Twitter users sorted themselves into just two broad camps based on their everyday interests. These camps closely mirror the left-right coalition structure in Swedish politics. The strongest patterns appeared at the political extremes, while centrist parties showed weaker cultural alignment."

    "text": "Why It Matters\nThis suggests that lifestyle polarization isn’t a quirk of the American two-party system. Even in a country with proportional representation and coalition governments, political identity has become intertwined with everyday cultural choices. We’re not just disagreeing about taxes and healthcare—we’re living in separate cultural universes.\nOur research reveals that brands operate in a politically polarized landscape whether they acknowledge it or not. Even ostensibly neutral product categories, like sports, finance, arts, entertainment, can carry implicit political associations that shape who engages with them. When brands target “environmentally conscious consumers” or “finance enthusiasts,” they’re not just targeting a hobby or interest; they’re targeting a broader cultural-political identity that includes distinct media consumption patterns, values, and social networks. The study shows this isn’t unique to America’s two-party system but happens in multi-party democracies too, meaning international brands can’t assume European or Scandinavian markets are immune to culture wars.\nFor marketers, this means traditional segmentation strategies are incomplete. Demographics and psychographics tell only part of the story. Instead, the cultural-political identity is a hidden dimension that determines whether your message resonates or repels. Influencer partnerships, product positioning, and even category choice now carry political weight. The “neutral middle” where brands can safely appeal to everyone is smaller than most marketers assume. Brands that ignore this reality risk either leaving money on the table by failing to connect with their natural audience, or accidentally alienating customers by sending mixed cultural signals. Understanding these cultural fault lines isn’t about “getting political” – it’s about understanding the actual structure of your market."

    "text": "What I like about the social sciences is that instead of just building models to predict outcomes, we get to dig into the why behind human behavior. Given that we all witness human behavior all the time, everyone has their own little theories of why people do what they do. The challenge of social science research is to move beyond this anecdotal evidence and figure out what actually drives behavior on a larger scale. The crux is then to communicate these insights in a way that is understandable and useful to others. On this page, I share some of the academic research projects that I conducted during my Ph.D.\n\nMediated Cues. How Elite Polarization is Transported Through the Media\nwith Väinö Yrjänäinen and Måns Magnusson\nDo people become more polarized because politicians say polarizing things in the news, or do politicians say polarizing things because people are already polarized? We studied 25 years of French newspaper coverage (n=1,000,000+ articles) and public opinion surveys to find out. The answer: both happen, but it depends on the issue. For some topics, media coverage of elite politicians clearly drives public opinion. For others, politicians seem to follow where public opinion is already going. This means there’s no one-size-fits-all explanation for how political polarization spreads. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nHow Elite Negativity Shapes Voter Affect: Evidence from the 2021 German Federal Election\nsolo-authored; currently under review at German Politics\nWhen a political party attacks its opponents on Twitter, does it make voters dislike those opponents more? Using transformer models and OLS regression, I analyzed tweets from candidates in Germany’s 2021 election alongside biweekly voter survey data to find out. The answer is yes: when Party A criticizes Party B on social media, Party A’s supporters report disliking Party B more. The effect is strongest among people who already identify strongly with their party, and it holds up regardless of whether the parties might form a coalition together or how ideologically similar they are. Also, the opposite is not true: a party don’t criticize other parties more if they know that their supporters don’t like these parties. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nDo Liberals Drive Volvos Everywhere? Assessing Cultural Bundles in Sweden\nwith Anastasia Menshikova, Elida Izani Binti Ibrahim, and Miriam Hurtado Bodell; currently under review at Social Media+Society\nIn the U.S., we know that political views often cluster with lifestyle choices – like the stereotype that liberals drive Priuses. But does this happen in countries with more than two major parties? We analyzed what 12,000 politically active Swedish Twitter users follow using mixed membership clustering to see if political affiliation predicts their cultural tastes. It does. Swedish voters’ media consumption, cultural interests, religious views, and even sense of humor align with their partisan identity. Political polarization isn’t just about policy disagreements – it’s seeping into everyday lifestyle choices, even in a multi-party democracy like Sweden. READ MORE HERE.\n\n\nMedia Slant as Political Refraction. Measuring Political Media Slant and Polarization in the French Media Landscape\nwith Rubing Shen, Arnault Chatelain, and Etienne Ollion\nHow can we measure whether a newspaper leans left or right without relying on subjective judgments? We developed a new method that analyzes how journalists talk about political issues differently than politicians do. By looking at subtle differences in word choice and framing, we can detect political bias at a very fine level, down to individual paragraphs. We tested this on major French newspapers from 2000-2010 and found that mainstream media became increasingly polarized during this period. This gives researchers and the public a tool to track media bias objectively over time.\n\n\nPerceptions of Intergenerational Mobility in Germany, Sweden, and the UK: Insights from Machine-Learning Text Analysis\nwith Alexi Gugushvili and Patrick Präg; preprint; currently under review at European Journal of Sociology\nWhen people compare their lives to their parents’, what are they actually comparing? We used LLMs and clustering-algorithms to analyze thousands of open-ended survey responses from Germany, Sweden, and the UK. While traditional research focuses on income, education, and job status, we found that people think about much more: home ownership, family life, freedom, lifestyle choices, and opportunities. What matters also varies dramatically by country: Swedes emphasize education, Brits focus on housing, Germans talk about freedom and lifestyle. Gender matters too: women are more likely to mention education and family, while men focus on income and career. Understanding what people actually care about when they think about social mobility gives us a richer picture than traditional metrics alone. READ MORE HERE."

We experience this in our everyday lives in political discussions with peers and when reading the news.

Especially in Europe, where news coverage tends to be less overtly partisan than in the U.S. Put differently, the question this project aimed to answer is: how do people learn “which views go together”?\nTo answer this question, my collaborators (two statistics scholars from Sweden) and I decided that we should take a step back and ask ourselves: where can people learn about these alignments? How can we measure and model this alignment process? And, finally, how can we determine whether this process has actually taken place?\nThe response we came up with was that people learn about this from the news and through discussions with peers. We cannot observe peer discussions, but we can try to quantify what folks pick up from the news by measuring the associations between parties/politicians and issues. Furthermore, we can use longitudinal survey data to document that views have actually aligned with political positioning on certain things.\nExtant research has highlighted two roles for the media. On the one hand, the media do tell people what politicians and parties think about certain issues. Hence, people can learn which views are acceptable given you have a certain political identity. On the other hand, the media also reflect opinion divisions in the public. Thus, the final research question we aimed to answer is: does media coverage drive political polarization, or does it merely reflect divisions that already exist?\nThe short answer after analyzing 25 years of French data is that is not really an “either/or” but actually a “both, but with some nuance.”"

    "text": "What We Did\nWe identified and tracked ideological alignment for 18 political issues from 1980-2005 in French survey data. Furthermore, we used Probabilistic Word Embeddings to track the associations of those issues with political elites and parties in more than 1 million newspaper articles from Le Monde. Thus, we tracked both public opinion alignment and media coverage patterns.\nFinally, we employed a set of Mixed-Effects models to uncover which pathway (media \\(\\rightarrow\\) public opinion or public opinion \\(\\rightarrow\\) media) dominates and what could drive this."

    "section": "Our Findings",
    "text": "Our Findings\nThe feedback loop is real and roughly balanced. Media coverage linking issues to partisan politicians increases public polarization by about the same magnitude that existing public divisions drive media to cover issues as political conflicts. The effects are equal, and neither really dominates.\nIt’s about ambient exposure, not breaking news. Media influence works through accumulated coverage over months and years, not immediate reaction to recent headlines. Partisan associations form gradually, almost subconsciously, through sustained exposure. That experimental research showing immediate opinion shifts? It captures something real but misses how opinion structures that actually crystallize in the real world.\nThe inverted-U pattern nobody predicted. We find that people with moderate education levels (elementary through high school) show responses to media framing 3-4 times stronger than either the least or most educated. This is probably as the least educated aren’t sufficiently exposed to or processing political coverage. The highly educated have frameworks for critical evaluation. But that middle? They’re encountering partisan signals regularly while lacking sophisticated filters. This is your persuadable middle – and it’s larger than you think.\nIssue maturity is everything. Whether an issue already has strong partisan associations fundamentally determines the dynamic. I watched emerging issues with low baseline polarization show strong top-down media effects. Established partisan issues showed the reverse: media followed public opinion more than it shaped it."

    "section": "Takeaways",
    "text": "Takeaways\nMy biggest takeaway from this research isn’t a finding but rather the conviction that reality is almost always more complex than our first-order theories predict, and that our measurement should reflect that. When I started this project, I was convinced that its a one-way street: media shapes opinion. However, reading more on existing results and explicitly testing for them in the analyses revealed more nuance.\nFurthermore, existing work often assumes that education makes people more attentive to the news and, thus, predicts more political sophistication and better alignment. While the latter finding is true according to my data, the susceptibility for change is a more nuanced story.\nFinally, not all issues “behaved” the same way – an effect found in one case is not the same in another. This means that there is tremendous value in comparing a broad set of cases and coming up with a theoretical justification that actually explains how this variation comes about to make better predictions.\nFor industry applications, this means that measurement systems need to be desinged in such a way that they can detect bidirectional relationships, heterogeneous effects, non-linear patterns, and dynamics that vary by context. Yes, this is harder than running a simple regression or A/B test, but if you’re making strategic decisions about content, products, or campaigns worth millions of dollars, shouldn’t your measurement be as sophisticated as your operations?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In one of my dissertation articles I built a measurement system that tracks messaging-to-attitude relationships at scale, with temporal precision, and directional specificity. The approach combines collecting digital trace data (i.e., political candidates’ Tweets), transformer-based classification (enabling scale), high-frequency surveying (enabling temporal analysis), and directional modeling (revealing asymmetries).\nThis unlocks research questions previously too expensive or time-consuming to answer: Does competitive messaging work? How fast do crises affect reputation? When do partnership announcements reshape perceptions? Do attacks require response?\nThe infrastructure cost is modest: fine-tuning a language model requires around 10 hours of annotating data, 1 hour of writing code (spread over multiple iterations to find the optimal parameters), and minimal compute (in this case, my 2022 MacBook Pro). After that, classification is essentially free. If you already track attitudes through surveys or panels, adding the messaging side is straightforward.\nThe political science findings – that attacks work asymmetrically, effects emerge within weeks, and defensive messaging often fails – probably do not necessarily generalize to use cases outside the political realm. But the real value is having a method to test these dynamics in your specific context rather than assuming what works in politics works for brands, or vice versa."

I collected 22,828 tweets from 1,537 candidates and paired them with bi-weekly surveys of about 1,000 voters from July 2021 through February 2022.\nI used GottBERT – a German AI model trained on 145 billion words – to detect genuinely polarizing rhetoric that explicitly draws “us versus them” battle lines. This delivered time-stamped, directional measurements of who attacked whom, when, and how often – something no human coding team could achieve at this scale."

    "text": "The Findings\nWhen your side attacks opponents, your audience views those opponents more negatively. Strong and significant. When Party A went after Party B, Party A’s supporters developed measurably worse attitudes toward Party B. They did not like their own party better, though.\nThe interesting part: When your side gets attacked, your audience doesn’t rally. I expected supporters to circle the wagons when their party was under fire or develop hostility toward attackers. Neither happened. Effects were tiny, insignificant, and pointed in the opposite direction.\nI believe three factors explain this: attention asymmetry (you’re more likely to see your own side’s messages), motivated reasoning (people discount attacks on their side but process their side’s attacks as valid), and noise normalization (audiences expect conflict, so attacks don’t trigger rally effects)."

Affective polarization decreased significantly within weeks. Elite signals about cooperation reshaped attitudes just as quickly as attacks did."

    "text": "The Limitations\nI’m transparent: This isn’t definitive causal evidence. Survey respondents might not have been exposed to specific tweets I measured. Omitted variables could drive both messaging and attitudes. Social media might not perfectly represent broader communication patterns.\nMy defense: polarizing rhetoric on Twitter reflects broader patterns audiences encounter across channels. Journalists quote tweets, messaging coordinates across platforms, and digital communication signals what’s happening elsewhere. The temporal precision, directional specificity, and theoretical consistency provide strong suggestive evidence – but true causation would of course require experiments.\nThat’s my research contribution: not just documenting problems, but showing they’re measurable, rapid, and therefore potentially solvable – in politics and beyond."

    "text": "Hi! My name is Felix and this is my personal website. I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Sociology at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. I live in Boston with my partner (who is doing her Ph.D. in Sociology, too) and two gorgeous cats. I am a German citizen and have a valid work permit for the U.S.\nI spent years doing research in the field of cultural and political sociology, asking big questions about human behavior and waiting even longer for answers. This career gave me great opportunities: I lived in Germany, Sweden, France, and the U.S., I met great and interesting people, and learned a lot. However, between endless research timelines, publishing and revision cycles, and the slow churn of academic life, I also realized that I was craving something different: the chance to see my work make an impact more immediately and directly. Who cares about a ten-page journal article that gets 1,000 downloads and maybe influences a few other researchers if it doesn’t change anything in the real world?\nThe closest you can get to experiencing impact in academia is through teaching and conference visits. I have been teaching younger folks how to go after social science questions in R and Python throughout my entire academic career (starting right after graduating from my Bachelor’s program) and also attended and presented at more than 10 academic conferences. These occasions showed me what I love most about this work: solving problems and telling stories with data. There is nothing I enjoy more than the moment when a visualization clicks, when a pattern emerges from messy data, when numbers suddenly tell a story that changes how someone sees a problem. I want to do that outside the university, with data that’s as exciting and dynamic as the questions it can answer.\nThat desire for real-world impact led me to work as a consulting analyst for Statistical Horizons, where I got my first taste of what data work looks like outside academia. I crunched performance data for reports and dashboards, prepared marketing campaigns using customer data that I collected online, and created reports that made an immediate and measurable impact. It confirmed what I suspected: I want to do this full-time.\nSo I am looking for data analyst and data science roles where I can combine rigorous methodology with practical problem-solving. Where I can dive into rich datasets, uncover insights that actually shift decisions, and communicate findings in ways that resonate with and help the people who need them.\nThis portfolio is a glimpse of how I work – curious, methodical, sometimes a bit outside the box, but always driven by a desire to understand and explain. If you like what you see here, please reach out. I would love to connect and explore how I can bring this approach to your team."
